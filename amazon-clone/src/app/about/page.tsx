          Amazing.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon, is an American
          multinational corporation and technology company focusing on
          e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming,
          and artificial intelligence. It is considered one of the Big Five
          American technology companies; the other four are Alphabet (parent
          company of Google), Apple, Meta (parent company of Facebook), and
          Microsoft. Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos from his
          garage in Bellevue, Washington. The company initially was an online
          marketplace for books, but incrementally expanded into a multitude of
          product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker The
          Everything Store. The company has multiple subsidiaries, including
          Amazon Web Services, providing cloud computing, Zoox, a self-driving
          car division, Kuiper Systems, a satellite Internet provider, and
          Amazon Lab126, a computer hardware R&D provider. Other subsidiaries
          include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of
          Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased
          its market share and presence as a physical retailer. Amazon has a
          reputation as a disruptor of industries through technological
          innovation and aggressive reinvestment of profits into capital
          expenditures. As of 2023, it is the worlds largest online retailer and
          marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through
          AWS, live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as
          measured by revenue and market share. In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as
          the worlds largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by
          its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200
          million subscribers worldwide. It is the second-largest private
          employer in the United States. As of October 2023, Amazon is the
          12th-most visited website in the world and 82% of its traffic comes
          from the United States. Amazon also distributes a variety of
          downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video,
          MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books
          through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television
          content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
          studio which acquired in March 2022. It also produces consumer
          electronicsâ€”most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire
          tablets, and Fire TVs. Amazon has been criticized for customer data
          collection practices, a toxic work culture, censorship, tax avoidance,
          and anti-competitive behavior. Amazon.com is an e-commerce platform
          that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music,
          and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty
          products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products,
          industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches,
          lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools,
          automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies and consulting
          services. Amazon websites are country-specific (for example,
          amazon.com for the US and amazon.fr for France), though some offer
          international shipping. Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff
          Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical
          talent, as Microsoft was in the area. Amazon went public in May 1997.
          It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international
          operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom
          and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a
          diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer
          electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys. In
          2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused
          on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top
          of Amazons ecommerce platform. In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide
          website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web
          Information Service. AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise
          services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,and Elastic Compute
          Cloud (EC2) in 2008, allowing companies to rent data storage and
          computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the
          Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small
          companies (called third-party sellers) to sell products through
          Amazons warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.
